Image source, Getty Images

For the players and fans, Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi getting this injury in a situation where the offside flag should have been raised is so frustrating.

The frustration is when it is clear and obvious. Officials have been overseeing games for many years and they would always flag whether they were right or wrong.

Now technology has come into it, they are very reliant on VAR to make the right decision, the factual decision, about an offside. But, I think when an offside is so clear and obvious, it should be the duty of the assistant referee to put their flag up and stop play from the off.

When it is marginal, I understand we are a bit more hesitant when there are really fine margins, and we have seen those fine margins when goals have been given and it is a toenail to keep them on-side. I would understand it from that point of view, but it was on the halfway-line where the offside happened on Sunday, only for play to be allowed to continue.

It has been a matter of time. It has been a time bomb waiting to go off for somebody to get seriously injured. Awoniyi is the one that has got that injury - that horrific injury - because of it. Some will say it is only the first time it has happened in the duration of this rule, but it should never happen. That is how players will be looking at it, how fans and managers will be looking at it and saying 'it should never happen'. We should not wait for something to happen to reassess rules like this.

I don't like the ruling of it - it is on the halfway-line, it is clear and obviously offside, everybody in the stadium could probably see it. It should be for the assistant referee to make the decision. There are small margins in the box, I understand why they are a bit hesitant, but in open play, if somebody is sprinting, you could cause hamstring, quad, and all types of muscle injuries.

I am totally against this rule of waiting to put up the flag and I think most players and managers are as well. It's disappointing. I think it's a rule that nobody likes, and I'm sure in the summer off the back of this injury, one that will probably be reassessed.

Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Nicola Pearson","the frustration is when it is clear and obvious, it should be the duty of the assistant referee to put their flag up and stop play from the off . it is a toenail to keep the offside on-side, but it was on the halfway-line .

As a result, they are claiming Mbappe is owed 55m euros - a sum made up of the final third of his signing-on fee and three months' worth of wages which were unpaid.

They argue that a written contractual amendment would have had to be signed and submitted to the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) - the governing body for France's two professional divisions - for the change to be valid, and that no ""tangible proof"" of an agreement has been presented.

Mbappe brought the case to the LFP, whose disciplinary commission initially issued a non-binding ruling that PSG were to pay the sum.

It later deemed itself to have no jurisdiction over the matter because of an ongoing civil court case, which the player's team claims was only launched by PSG against the LFP ""in order to avoid disciplinary action"".

In February, the French Football Federation (FFF) dismissed Mbappe's subsequent appeal on the same grounds.

Speaking to BBC Sport, a lawyer with knowledge of PSG's case explains that the LFP's decision came from the fact that it could make a judgement based on the original contract - ""but what's being debated is whether it was amended"".

In December, following the LFP's latest decision, a club spokesperson reiterated that Mbappe had ""made clear public and private commitments that the club simply asks to be honoured"", and that PSG remained hopeful of ""an amicable solution"".

The club also claimed that Mbappe refused the LFP's offer for mediation.

Last month, Mbappe's lawyers held a press conference to announce they had ""gone on the attack"", having notably obtained the seizure of the 55m euros from PSG's accounts through a court decision.

They also indicated that they were filing a complaint claiming PSG put pressure on Mbappe to renew, which the club denies, and that they had sent a letter to the FFF asking them to notify Uefa on the situation.

In a hearing on Monday, after PSG contested the precautionary seizure, the club announced that a counterclaim for 98m euros (£82.6m) in damages would be brought forward as part of their wider case.

In their court submission, the club's lawyers asserted that the counterclaim was prompted by Mbappe's ""deceptive behaviour during negotiations to revise his contract"".

The striker's team, meanwhile, reiterated that despite the counterclaim there was ""no legal basis for deferring payment of the sum due"".

""The aim is not to recover the 98m euros, but rather to show that if he owes us money, his claim is unfounded,"" PSG lawyer Renaud Semerdjian told the AFP.

For the club, the standoff also represents a reversal in the days where player power reigned supreme - the new-look (albeit still as spendthrift) PSG styles itself as a project built around a collective unit rather than individual talents.

Mbappe's team, meanwhile, claimed in their April press conference that it was PSG who had put him under pressure to re-sign back in 2023 through ""scandalous and indecent practices"", and that they would be joining the players' union in its legal action against the ""lofts"".

A decision on the seizing of the club's accounts is expected on 26 May - the same day as a separate hearing on the wider case, in which the French football authorities initially dismissed Mbappe's appeals.

While the 26-year-old will have wrapped up his maiden season in Spain the previous evening, Paris St-Germain will be in the midst of a week bookended by the Coupe de France and Champions League finals.

Oxford United, the 1986 League Cup winners, were in a slump, having dropped from the second tier to the fourth since 1999 - and were sliding down League Two when owner Firoz Kassam sacked Graham Rix.

Kassam, the club's unpopular owner, invited out-of-work manager Chris Turner to watch their 1-0 defeat by Swansea - and most people thought he was the new manager, including the Oxford Mail, external and some players.

But instead... ""It was quite bizarre,"" said former U's striker Basham. ""Five or six guys came in, in a line. They all stood in front of us and none of them spoke a word of English, apart from one translator.""

Goiran said ""all the players had wide-open eyes wondering 'who are these guys?'"".

Those guys were Diaz, head coach Horacio Rodriguez, another coach Raul Marcovich, Goiran, fitness trainer Pablo Fernandez, doctor Rafael Giulietti and translator Giuilliano Iacoppi.

But wait, how did it come to this? It all starts in Monaco - where Kassam and Goiran lived and Diaz also had a home having played for the club.

Kassam approached a friend of a friend, Goiran, who has worked as a football agent and consultant, to help him find a manager and the Monegasque suggested Diaz - who had left River Plate in 2002.

At the time it was widely reported that Diaz was not being paid to be Oxford manager - and Kassam said he had ""promised him shares in the club in return for success"".

But Goiran, speaking 20 years on, says Kassam's company Firoka, but not the club, instead paid Diaz and Goiran consulting fees in Monaco.

And the question many have asked - why did a manager with five Argentine titles and the Copa Libertadores come to League Two Oxford?

Goiran says it was part of a project to get to the Premier League in five years - but after a bitter ending, Diaz, who is now Corinthians manager in Brazil, never worked in England or even Europe again.

Brian McLauchlin

BBC Sport Scotland Senior Reporter

Defeat at Tynecastle on Wednesday night brought an end to 16 years of top-flight football for St Johnstone.

But given the club's fortunes in the Premiership in recent seasons, should we be too surprised?

It was the 2020-21 season when Saints created history by winning both major cup competitions and finished fifth in the Premiership.

All looked to be rosy at McDiarmid Park with a squad full of Scottish talent who knew exactly how to win games of football.

But the warning signs were there early on the following season. Despite gallant away performances against Galatasaray and LASK, the European adventures were over by the end of August.

A run of eight straight defeats in the league between the start of December and the end of January saw the club plummet towards the bottom end of the table.

Although they reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, losing 1-0 to Celtic, there was huge disappointment when they fell at the first hurdle in their defence of the Scottish Cup to lowly Kelty Hearts.

Premiership survival was only achieved after play-off success over two legs against Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

The following campaign in the league was marginally better with a ninth-place finish. But early exits in both cup competitions left a huge sense of disappointment in Perth.

Davidson left the club towards the end of the season having been player, coach and then manager over a ten-year period.

After a short and unsuccessful spell for Steven MacLean, Craig Levein was tempted back into management.

St Johnstone had been purchased by Geoff Brown in 1986, and along with his son Steven, they turned St Johnstone into one of the best run clubs in Scotland, but they had now decided it was time for someone else to take over the reins.

And shortly after Saints secured their Premiership place on the final day of the 2023-24 campaign, the club was sold to a group of American entrepreneurs.

Levein was sacked in September, just a matter of weeks after the takeover was concluded, with Simo Valkari taking over.

And despite some brave performances, including a home win over champions Celtic, they were unable to avoid the drop.

Valakri said ""there were no excuses"" and the team were simply ""not good enough"".

He stressed ""things need to change"" if they are to bounce back to the top flight at the first time of asking.

The 52-year-old also says he wants to stay, but when asked if he expects to be at the club, he answered: ""we will see"".

The next few weeks and months in Perth will be telling, with some big decisions required by those in charge.","the saints finished fifth in the premiership in the 2020-21 season . it was the first time the club's fortunes in the Premiership in recent seasons . but the warning signs were there early on the following year . despite gallant away performances, the european adventures were over by the end of august .",0.0,0.0,0.1305232558139535,0.3643410852713179,0.09136627906976744,0.2550387596899225

Greg Playfair

Fan writer

While 'McInnes Mania' has absorbed all of Scottish football's attention over the past few days, one man that has been forgotten about is interim head coach Liam Fox.

Now, I'm not saying he should be offered the role on a permanent basis like Steven Naismith was two years ago, but he deserves more credit for picking up the pieces on a couple of occasions this season.

Fox has gone on two rescue missions; the first back in late September, to arrest the slide which saw us in 11th place in the league - above Hibs - following our worst ever league start on record.

The latest task was to take control of a side who had seen both European and Scottish Cup dreams dissolve into the ether and were nervously looking over their shoulder at a relegation play-off following five matches without a win.

The boyhood Jambo wasn't presented any opportunity to earn glory or go into the history books as one of the heroes, instead he was told to keep us out of them.

Whether Fox will be in charge for the remainder of the season remains to be seen, but he certainly can hold his head high following his latest stint that has seen us pick up two wins from two.

It's an intriguing prospect having Derek McInnes as the main man at Tynecastle, but one thing for certain is he wouldn't be wheeling and dealing on his own.

Much has been said about whether McInnes would like to work in such a set-up, but the question is: has he ever been offered the opportunity before to do so?

I know he previously turned down Sunderland and Rangers while at Aberdeen, but both those clubs had their own travails at the time and results afterwards proved that to be correct.

Given where McInnes' stock is right now, is there a bigger job than the Hearts one that will come knocking at his door? This season hasn't been his greatest at Kilmarnock, but I'm not concerned with that when it's compared to his previous experience.

I'm not old enough to remember Jim Jefferies joining Hearts from Falkirk, but I'm assured by older Jambos that this has a similar feeling to it.

I'm hoping the St Johnstone game on Wednesday takes care of itself - which would mean we potentially relegate one of McInnes' former clubs at Tynecastle - and the McInnes media circus can start to pack up when we take on Kilmarnock at Rugby Park.

I, like every other Jambo, will be glad when the final whistle blows on Sunday afternoon for the final time in the 2024-2025 season and hope that our new manager will be making plans that evening for how to bounce back in the new campaign after the summer.",'McInnes Mania' has absorbed all of Scottish football's attention over the past few days . interim head coach Liam Fox has gone on two rescue missions . the first was to arrest the slide which saw us in 11th place in the league - above Hibs .,0.0,0.0,0.10110117207055984,0.4584160114262154,0.07077082044939188,0.32089120799835075

Liam McLeod

BBC Sport Scotland Commentator

Aberdeen need an answer and quickly.

Wednesday's latest capitulation was a sobering experience for the Dons' fans as they were taken apart by effectively a second-string Celtic side on their own patch.

It was the first time they have conceded five times at Pittodrie in almost a decade when St Johnstone won by the same 5-1 scoreline that has supporters fearful of what a full-strength Celtic side could do to them in next week's Scottish Cup final.

Out of those who started for the champions in the Granite City, arguably captain Callum McGregor is the only one who will be in Brendan Rodgers' XI at Hampden.

In five games against the champions this term, Aberdeen have shipped 19 goals, including six the last time they met at the national stadium.

It is becoming more difficult to construct an argument that the odds can be upset in the wake of this one.

The latest embarrassing reverse means that fourth place is as high as Aberdeen can finish, with Hibernian's draw at St Mirren enough to secure third for the Easter Road outfit. Once 23 points clear of them, the Dons have been left behind.

It is now a straight shoot-out with Dundee United at Tannadice on Saturday for fourth place.

Concerningly for Thelin, the Dons have only taken two points away from home against top-six teams this season - the 2-2 draw at Celtic Park and the 3-3 draw at Easter Road that changed the course of both clubs' campaigns.

Thelin's Premiership record is now exactly the same as his sacked predecessor Barry Robson.

Mickey Thomas says he has never seen football club owners boasting a better relationship with fans than Wrexham's Hollywood duo Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney.

Wrexham will play in English football's second tier next season for the first time in 43 years after clinching second spot in League One last weekend.

The Dragons have become the first club in the history of England's top five divisions to secure three straight promotions.

Their spectacular run has come following the takeover of the club by Reynolds and McElhenney in 2021, when they were a non-league side.

""What they have done is unique - it's incredible,"" Wrexham legend Thomas told this week's Feast of Football podcast.

""The transformation from the National League to where they are now is massive and they have done it in the right way.

""I have never seen owners of a football club have the association they have with the players but more so with the fans. The connection is unreal.""

Former Manchester United player Thomas, 70, made his name at Wrexham in the 1970s before returning to the club at the back-end of his career, when he famously scored a spectacular free-kick in a shock FA Cup victory over Arsenal.

The ex-Wales international (above) had not met Reynolds and McElhenney until last Saturday's promotion-clinching win over Charlton, when he was invited to the owners' box and then asked to celebrate on the pitch alongside them afterwards.

""I don't think anyone can really believe what's happened to the football club,"" Thomas added.

""Everyone wants to go and watch Wrexham. You can't get a ticket these days.

""It's not just Wrexham, it's globally. They have captured the whole universe haven't they? I am sure if you go to the moon, there'd be someone there asking 'how are Wrexham doing?'.

""I didn't see this happening. But what they have done is they have got the right man in charge in Phil Parkinson and the recruitment has been second to none.""

As Wrexham prepare to compete with some heavyweight clubs in the Championship next season, Thomas says another promotion is not inconceivable.

""We know they will do well to finish halfway in the Championship or whatever, but you wouldn't put it past them, that they could get automatic promotion next year,"" he said.

""You might laugh at that, but you never know with these two guys, everything they touch turns to gold.""",Wrexham will play in english football's second tier next season for the first time in 43 years . the dragons have become the first club in the history of England's top five divisions to secure three straight promotions . their spectacular run follows the takeover of the club by Reynolds and McElhenney in 2021 .,0.0,0.0,0.2249007936507937,0.3502865961199294,0.1574305555555556,0.24520061728395057

A former Premier League frontman for Burnley, Wolves and Sunderland, Fletcher proved his worth as Wrexham won promotion from League Two, earning a one-year contract-extension last summer.

Fletcher admitted in March he had expected to have returned to retirement, adding that he didn't see ""why he would want to stop"" given his ongoing impact.

He played a super-sub role as Wrexham returned to the second-tier for the first time in 42 years, with all bar two of his 43 appearances coming off the bench as he again scored eight league goals.

In his exit announcement, Fletcher added: ""I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to come here and fall back in love with the game!

""To have had the experiences and the opportunities that this club has given me has been just incredible. And this group of lads are the best that I have ever shared a changing room with.

""It's not just a team or a changing room. This group of boys , fans and staff have been my family for the past two years.

""You welcomed me with open arms and open hearts and made me feel like I had a purpose again.""

Fletcher's announcement came after goalkeeper Mark Howard – who had figured in all three of Wrexham's successive promotions – also revealed he would not be staying beyond the end of his current deal.

Wrexham co-owner Rob McElhenney said on social media that such exits were ""the worst part"", adding: ""they are not just players on the team. They are my friends and people I admire"".

In response Wrexham director Humphrey Ker posted he was ""slightly in awe"" of Fletcher ""when he arrived at Wrexham, on account of his extraordinary career at the very top of the game"".

Simon Stone

Chief football news reporter

Manchester City striker Divin Mubama will not be part of the club's Premier League 2 squad next season but it is not clear whether he will be sent out on loan or granted a permanent move.

The jewel in West Ham's FA Youth Cup-winning team in 2023, 20-year-old Mubama joined City the following year after his contract expired at the London Stadium.

Mubama made two senior appearances for City this season - adding to his 18 under David Moyes at West Ham - and scored against League Two Salford in the FA Cup third round in January.

However, he has spent most of the campaign in PL2 and took his tally in the end of season play-offs to five with two second half efforts in Friday's semi-final win over Manchester United.

City's Elite Development Squad head coach Ben Wilkinson knows Mubama will not be around next term. But he is also aware the next steps for any young striker are hazardous.

""We've got players in our team we'd expect not to see next year because they're ready to make that step and he's probably one of them,"" said Wilkinson.

""It's trying to help with that next step and guide them in the right direction.

""We've had it the last three, four, five years with some real high potential players from the 18s and 21s and now they're playing on our TV screens every other week.

""The problem is it has been notoriously hard for young strikers to go out on loan and succeed in the Championship or League One. You used to have someone next to you and now you're a 19, 20-year-old number nine up against two big centre halves and the service might not be great.""

Wilkinson cites the example of Liam Delap, who had patchy loan spells at Stoke and Preston around the same age Mubama is now, before going to Hull last season, where he scored eight times in 32 appearances.

That persuaded Ipswich to take a chance by signing him permanently in a £20m deal last August, since when Delap has gone on to become one of the most coveted young strikers in the Premier League.

Wilkinson added: ""Liam was outstanding at this level, then had two or three loans and his numbers weren't outstanding.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/15/south-african-refugee-antisemitic-posts,2025-05-15 00:00:00.000000,White Afrikaner brought to US by Trump administration has history of antisemitic posts,"One of the white Afrikaners brought into the US as refugees by the Trump administration this week has a history of antisemitic social media posts, despite the White House using alleged antisemitism as a rationale for deporting pro-Palestinian protesters.

Charl Kleinhaus posted on X in 2023 that “Jews are untrustworthy and a dangerous group.” In another post last fall, he shared a rightwing, nationalist YouTube video that was later removed, titled: “‘We’ll shoot ILLEGAL Immigrants!’ – Poland’s Illegal Islamic immigrant solution,” with clapping emojis.

A number of Kleinhaus’s posts also promote the conspiracy theory that white people in South Africa are being particularly persecuted.

Kleinhaus confirmed to several media outlets, including the Bulwark and New York Times that he was the owner of the account that contained antisemitic and racist posts, though he insisted to the Times that he was not antisemitic and claimed to have written a post in error while on medication.

The Trump administration has engaged in a systematic campaign to arrest and attempt to deport pro-Palestinian activists in recent months, claiming that they are engaging in antisemitism. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said last month it will begin screening immigrants’ social media activity for antisemitism, using it “as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests”.

Kleinhaus, however, was recently granted refugee status by the US government, along with 58 other white South Africans, and landed this week at Washington Dulles international airport.

“We just packed our bags and left” for “safety reasons”, Kleinhaus, who according to his LinkedIn profile owns a mining company in South Africa, told the New York Times on arrival.

Afrikaners are a white ethnic minority that ruled South Africa during apartheid, implementing harsh policies of racial segregation in the country until the regime was officially abolished in 1994.

Some white supremacist Afrikaners – as well as Donald Trump and his biggest financial backer, Elon Musk, who was born and raised in South Africa – have promoted the false conspiracy theory that there is a “white genocide” taking place in the country.

In February, Trump signed an executive order saying that Afrikaners were unjustly being persecuted with little intervention from the South African government, and granted a group of them refugee status.

A senior DHS official said in a statement: “The Department of Homeland Security vets all refugee applicants. Any claims of misconduct are thoroughly investigated, and appropriate action will be taken as necessary. DHS does not comment on individual application status.”

Kleinhaus did not immediately respond to questions.

This week, the Episcopal church said it would be ending its refugee resettlement program with the US government, pointing to the Trump administration’s approach to resettle the white Afrikaners.

“It has been painful to watch one group of refugees, selected in a highly unusual manner, receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or dangerous conditions for years,” said the presiding bishop of the church, the Rev Sean W Rowe.
